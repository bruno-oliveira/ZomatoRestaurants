# ZomatoRestaurants

The overall idea of this project is to develop a web application that uses the Zomato API, to serve its users with the most
relevant and up to date information regarding the best places to eat in the main european capitals and cities.

This application lets a user see all the restaurants available in a city and see their respective websites to decide which
restaurant to go to. 

In future releases of this app, the idea will be to have a google-maps like interface available that lets the user see which
restaurants are closer to its current location, introduced by setting a marker on the map and showing all the restaurants in a 
fixed distance (1,2 or 5km) of that same marker.
