# ZomatoRestaurants
An application made just for fun that tries to index restaurants in a more geographical way than current solutions

The overall idea of this project is to develop a web application that uses the Zomato API, to serve its users with the most
relevant and up to date information regarding the best places to eat in the main european capitals and cities.

This application lets a user see all the restaurants available in a city and see their respective websites to decide which
restaurant to go to. 

In future releases of this app, the idea will be to have a google-maps like interface available that lets the user see which
restaurants are closer to its current location, introduced by setting a marker on the map and showing all the restaurants in a 
fixed distance (1,2 or 5km) of that same marker.

It's also expected that some work can be done to index more international locations, such as Paris, Rome, London, amongst other famous european cities, but, it will be a work in progress.

 [*] As of, today, 18th Nov, the application has the angularMaps integrated, now, it's working on top of the ngMap framework.
 
 [*] As of November 19th, a Wiki that will serve both as an example for the app, as well, as a RoadMap detailing some of the more significant advancements made on each day will start being written more consistently. Some of the days will be reproduced trough the issues... Maybe this repo can go public once the app is finished... :D
 
 [*] 22nd November, 11:51, A new version was pushed to master... Major improvements, that include:
       - Official Google Javascript Maps API integrated;
       - Restaurant table appears on the map as pins;
       - Radius of circle now affects markers, as intended;
